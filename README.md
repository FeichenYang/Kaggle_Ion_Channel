# Kaggle_Ion_Channel
Kaggle Project "University of Liverpool - Ion Switching"

The goal is to identify the number of ion channels opened at a certain time point, based on the "signal" they detected. 

The challenge is (1) there's a lot of noise; (2) there's a systematic error called "drift", that needs to be removed. 

A decision tree was used to do the prediction.
